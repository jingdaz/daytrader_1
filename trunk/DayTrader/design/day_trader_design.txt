
- assume first stratey: over night holding, say 500 UVXY

- trade with whole holding so far. sell-buy or buy-sell switch

- add more when breaking out?

- mix strategy in future?

- use message queue for MM?

RSI Calculation:
http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi

 		100
    RSI = 100 - --------
                 1 + RS

    RS = Average Gain / Average Loss

 To simplify the calculation explanation, RSI has been broken down into its basic components: RS, Average Gain and Average Loss. This RSI calculation is based on 14 periods, which is the default suggested by Wilder in his book. Losses are expressed as positive values, not negative values.

The very first calculations for average gain and average loss are simple 14 period averages.

    First Average Gain = Sum of Gains over the past 14 periods / 14.
    First Average Loss = Sum of Losses over the past 14 periods / 14.

The second, and subsequent, calculations are based on the prior averages and the current gain loss:

    Average Gain = [(previous Average Gain) x 13 + current Gain] / 14.
    Average Loss = [(previous Average Loss) x 13 + current Loss] / 14.



CCI Calculation:

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:commodity_channel_index_cci

CCI = (Typical Price  -  20-period SMA of TP) / (.015 x Mean Deviation)

Typical Price (TP) = (High + Low + Close)/3

Constant = .015

There are four steps to calculating the Mean Deviation:
1) Subtract the most recent 20-period average of the typical price from each period's typical price,
2) Take the absolute values of these numbers,
3) Sum the absolute values,
4) Divide by the total number of periods (20).
