
- assume first stratey: over night holding, say 500 UVXY

- trade with whole holding so far. sell-buy or buy-sell switch

- apply substraction, i.e., reserve more tx points first, then filter out bad ones.

- add more when breaking out?

- mix strategy in future?

- use message queue for MM?

RSI Calculation:
http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi

 		100
    RSI = 100 - --------
                 1 + RS

    RS = Average Gain / Average Loss

 To simplify the calculation explanation, RSI has been broken down into its basic components: RS, Average Gain and Average Loss. This RSI calculation is based on 14 periods, which is the default suggested by Wilder in his book. Losses are expressed as positive values, not negative values.

The very first calculations for average gain and average loss are simple 14 period averages.

    First Average Gain = Sum of Gains over the past 14 periods / 14.
    First Average Loss = Sum of Losses over the past 14 periods / 14.

The second, and subsequent, calculations are based on the prior averages and the current gain loss:

    Average Gain = [(previous Average Gain) x 13 + current Gain] / 14.
    Average Loss = [(previous Average Loss) x 13 + current Loss] / 14.



CCI Calculation:

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:commodity_channel_index_cci

CCI = (Typical Price  -  20-period SMA of TP) / (.015 x Mean Deviation)

Typical Price (TP) = (High + Low + Close)/3

Constant = .015

There are four steps to calculating the Mean Deviation:
1) Subtract the most recent 20-period average of the typical price from each period's typical price,
2) Take the absolute values of these numbers,
3) Sum the absolute values,
4) Divide by the total number of periods (20). 


Where to get stock intraday data for free?
How to free download last one month intraday data from Google finance?
 In Google finance, we can view even the intra-day stock chart for last one month may be even more for 1 minute time interval. As we increase the time interval the view span can be increased significantly. But there is no link to download this data directly.  I dig into Google finance and find out something very interesting. Whatever the chart you can see for an individual symbol, you can  download it also but with a little pain than yahoo finance  For intraday or 1min, 5 min, 30 min or 1 hr interval there is no way we can download it from yahoo finance. So here comes the Google finance to help us out.
